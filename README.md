PreAmp1 
=======

Collection of files related to my pre-amplifier project, based on DIY Audio circuits, Hifiberry DAC+ DSP, own circuit design as well ad 3D printed parts.
The aim is to make a lot of the functionality available with physical controls.

# 3D
This contains a faceplate for the Raspberry Pi 4 as well as a very sturdy assembly for the volume control potentiometer, enabling it to be placed on its own PCB, away from the main amplifier PCB.

# Functions
## Equaliser
Class for controlling the HifiberryOS/Beocreate DSP functions for the equaliser, using websockets for real-time control.
